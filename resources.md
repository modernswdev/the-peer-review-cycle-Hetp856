## GitHub Documentation
Because we are using GitHub extensively in this course, GitHub's documentation is a great resource to learn the ins-and-outs of using GitHub.

## The Agile Manifesto
The agile method is an integral part of modern software development. The Agile manifesto is a document from the founders of the agile method that documents the key components and values of the agile method.
